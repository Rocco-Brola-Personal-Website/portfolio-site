        <h3>Playing Soccer</h3>
        <p2>When I'm not coding I am most likely playing soccer. Ever since an early age, I have been obsessed with the sport. It not only keeps me in solid shape, but it pushes my brain to work harder than usual and problem solve on-the-spot. I love playing with my friends and it can serve as a great past time!</p>

            <h3>Watching Soccer</h3>
            <p2>And when I'm not playing soccer you can bet that I'm watching it. Ever since I quit college soccer to join this bootcamp, I have been able to dive deeper and deeper into my support for FC Barcelona. They are my favourite team and supporting them is one my favourite things to do on the weekend!</p>

        <h3>Hanging Out with Friends/Family</h3>
        <p3>Being in a family with really hardworkers, I value you time spent together very highly. I love being able to relax and watch a shoe with my family or even go out on dates with my lovely girlfriend! Additionally, I always find time for my friends whether that be at the beach or just someones house.</p>
